# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome from everyone.

This project uses Express for the server and VUE for the client UI.

**Credits goes also to:**

- [@oznu](https://github.com/oznu): Because I could learn a lot from homebridge-config-ui-x to be able to release version 4
- [@sunoo](https://github.com/Sunoo/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg): For the homebridge-camera-ffmpeg plugin
- [@phoboslab](https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg) for the decoder. Without it it would not be possible to display the cameras via an interface
